Welcome to GitHub Pages of Usman Rana

My name is Usman Rana, and I am currently doing a masters in Information Systems. I also work full time at Union Pacific as a train dispatcher. I'm fairly new to Information Systems, and currently learning the new system.



I was born and raised in Tucson, Az. Arizona is a beautiful state with great weather! I moved to Iowa when I was fourteen. I attended University of Iowa. But my favorite college sports team is Arizona Wildcats.
